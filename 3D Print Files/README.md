I wanted to put my Sixfab Pico LTE into an enclosure with a couple of SParkfun Qwiic
boards, and was learning FUsion, and created this enclosure.  It's a small flat
enclosure to hold the Pico LTE, and has two mounting areas for the larger SParkfun
Qwiic boards, or several of the smaller boards.

The top cover has 2mm x 2mm square holes for 3 Bivar PLPQ2-375 Light Pipes.

The screws that I used to secure the boards were from some OKW Enclosures that I
also use.  You can find them here: https://www.okwenclosures.com/en/Screws/A0304031.htm

TODO:

- Replace the top cover screw with a beveled screw to make it flush
